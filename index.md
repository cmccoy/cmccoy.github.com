I'm currently working as a Senior Staff Software Engineer on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute). There I've:

* Led the expansion of GCE's VM offering from a homogenous to heterogeneous product: I was technical lead for GCE's Compute Optimized VMs (C2) and next gen General Purpose (N2) series VMs, responsible for the end-to-end delivery of those products. 

  Along the way, we modernized parts of the node virtualization infrastructure to improve predictability and performance, and introducing capabilities for heterogeneity across the full stack - from capacity planning to public facing UIs and APIs. I co-led the introduction of AMD (N2D VMs) to Google Cloud.

* Worked closely with Google's platforms organization on next generation servers for Cloud and improved the new product introduction process - reducing cost while increasing quality and velocity of adding new hardware to Google Cloud.

* Led a performance telemetry team, which built out a 100+ terabyte repository of per-VM timeseries data, tooling for analyzing and visualizing kernel scheduler traces, and data pipelines and dashboards used by a variety of roles for debugging customer performance problems on the platform.

Before joining Google, I was a programmer in [Erick Matsen's group](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/research.html) within the fantastic [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) Computational Biology program.
