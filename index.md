I'm a programmer in [Erick Matsen](http://matsen.fhcrc.org)'s group, part of the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org) [Computational Biology program](http://research.fhcrc.org/computational-biology/en.html).

We work on developing and applying statistical methodologies for evolutionary inference using high-throughput sequencing data, with applications in immunology, virology, and metagenomics.

My published work is on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?sortby=pubdate&hl=en&user=ZqPTdFoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).

Software I've written is on GitHub under [@cmccoy](http://github.com/cmccoy) or [@fhcrc](http://github.com/fhcrc).

Occasionally I tweet as [@connoromccoy](http://twitter.com/connoromccoy).
