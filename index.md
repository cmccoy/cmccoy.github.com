I'm currently working as a Software Engineer on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute).

Before joining Google, I was a programmer in [Erick Matsen's group](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/research.html) within the fantastic [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) Computational Biology program.
